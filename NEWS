3.1.0 2018 05 19 Rocket Scientist

Add template formatting mechanism use that many places. (More work is
needed though.

Go over mechanism for marking child/parent text.

DRY code a more and expand tests, but  more refactoring, DRY, and more tests are
needed.

3.0.0 2018 05 11

Greatly revised in preparation for YAPC Glasgow

More aggressing refactoring, DRY'ing code. More aggressive
about creating a parallel deparse tree with its own node structure.

Add better API to extract text placing in the context of its parent.

This is just the first step though. A lot more work is planned
for better test coverage, tree structuring and tagging.
