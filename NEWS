3.0.0 2018 05 11

Greatly revised in preparation for YAPC Glasgow

More aggressing refactoring, DRY'ing code. More aggressive
about creating a parallel deparse tree with its own node structure.

Add better API to extract text placing in the context of its parent.

This is just the first step though. A lot more work is planned
for better test coverage, tree structuring and tagging.
