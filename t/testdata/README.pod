L<B::Deparse> is pretty extensively tested. Here we have the tests
taken from the Perl distirbution. I the distribution the data and
the test for the data are in one file.

We have separated out the data from the driver for a couple of
reasons.  First, I think it is just cleaner.

Also I believe that we can write one test driver that works on multiple
versions of Perl.  As the test driver gets better, multiple versions
can take advantage of that.

The same possbily can be said for the data too. We should be able to
find common parts of tests and separate use them across several
different versions of Perl.

Right now when a bug is found in L<B::Deparse>, it is fixed in that
version and future versions. But in reality we could also see if it is
relevant in previous versions of Perl and fix the prior versions as well.

Modularity is a wonderful thing that way.
